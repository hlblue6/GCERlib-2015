# GCERlib-2015



The "create" folder was copied and pasted from opencode: https://github.com/normanadvanced/OpenCode    

Many of the designs for this lib were also taken from opencode.

This library is far from fully tested. Do not trust every function. Isaac Yates will be presenting a talk about the driveTrain.h file during GCER 2015
